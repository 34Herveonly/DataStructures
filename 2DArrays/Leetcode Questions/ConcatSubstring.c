/*
Leetcode #30 - Substring with Concatenation of All Words
Different twist: Combines sliding window with hashmap and fixed-length word tracking.

Description:

Given a string s and a list of words, return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Why it's hard:

Requires managing multiple word boundaries, hashmap tracking, and sliding window logic in tandem.
