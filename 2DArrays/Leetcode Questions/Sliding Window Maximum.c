/*
Leetcode #239 - Sliding Window Maximum
Different twist: focuses on numerical values instead of substrings.

Description:

You are given an array of integers nums, and an integer k. Return the maximum value in every window of size k.

Why it's hard:

You need an efficient data structure (like a deque) to maintain the max in O(n) time.
