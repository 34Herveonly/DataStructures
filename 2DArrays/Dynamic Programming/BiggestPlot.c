/*
 Our goal is to find the largest possible square-shaped patch of connected fertile land — meaning all 1s — without including any infertile (0) cells inside it.
 We do this by checking, for each plot, how big a square of fertile land can end there, using info from the top, left, and top-left neighboring plots.
