/*
Leetcode #42 - Trapping Rain Water
Different twist: Simulates physical intuition using two pointers and pre-processing.

Description:

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Why it's hard:

Needs careful use of two pointers or precomputed max arrays to achieve O(n) time and O(1)/O(n) space.
